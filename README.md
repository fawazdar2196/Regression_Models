Project Description

This project demonstrates the application of various regression techniques, 
including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression (degrees 2 and 3), and Ridge Regression, 
to fit a set of sample data points. The project involves fitting these models to the data, visualizing the results,
and evaluating their performance using key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score. The analysis aims to highlight the differences
in performance and suitability of each model for different types of data relationships, providing insights into model selection and evaluation.
