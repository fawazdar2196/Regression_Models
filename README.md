# 📊 Regression Models Analysis

This project demonstrates the application of various regression techniques, including **Linear Regression**, **Polynomial Regression (degrees 2 and 3)**, and **Ridge Regression**, to fit a set of sample data points.  

The goal is to compare how different regression models perform on the same dataset and provide insights into **model selection** and **evaluation**.

---

## 📌 Overview
- Fit sample data using **Linear Regression**, **Polynomial Regression (degrees 2 & 3)**, and **Ridge Regression**  
- Visualize fitted regression lines against the original data  
- Evaluate models using key performance metrics:  
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
  - **R² Score**  
- Understand which models work best for different types of data relationships  

---

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Data fitting with multiple regression techniques  
- ✅ Visualization of regression curves vs. original data points  
- ✅ Model evaluation with MSE and R² Score  
- ✅ Easy-to-extend structure for adding more regression models
